When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to collaberate with other people or I want to edit my project from other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    1. I don't need that freqent action.
    2. Sometimes the remote may not be the same as local, so there will be conflict. If Git automatically syncs, we have to check every time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: clone other's repository to your account and work on it, but any changes on your forks will not affect the original project.
    Clone: Clone a repository from Github to your local computer.
    Branch: a part of a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can always keep your local work as near as remote, so when you pull or push next time, there will not be too many conflicts that you should handle.
